# BinaryTreeTraversal

An algorithm which can rebuild binary tree from two of it's traversals (INORDER and POST/PRE ORDER).

### Input data:

->number of sets  
->post/pre order traversal of 1st set  
->inorder traversal of 1st set  
->...  

### Output data:

->set number  
->remaining traversal (PRE/POST ORDER)  
->LEVELORDER traversal  

### Complexity

#### Time



#### Space
