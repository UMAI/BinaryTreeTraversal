# BinaryTreeTraversal

An algorithm which can rebuild binary tree from two of it's traversals (INORDER and POST/PRE ORDER)

### Input data:

->number of sets
->inorder traversal of 1st set
->post/pre order traversal of 1st set
->...

### Output data:

->set number
->remaining traversal (PRE/POST ORDER)
->LEVELORDER traversal

### Complexity
